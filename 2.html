<p>I'm always walking to the same old place
  in case I see your face
  <br>I'm gonna buy a drink and while I wait
  <br>I'ma eat my cake, make the same mistakes
  <br>I know that you don't think that I can be the one
</p>
<p>
  But I can be your one
  <br>I may be acting crazy now, it's getting late
  <br>They took my heart away
  <br>But I'll be okay, 'cause
</p>

  In my dream world
  <br>I'm still your dream girl
  <br>No if, buts, or maybes
  <br>I'm still your baby
<p>  
  <br>Ooh, I'm still your dream girl
  <br>Ooh, I'm still your dream girl
</p>
  <br>Sometimes I like to get a little drunk
  <br>Just to have some fun and be no one
  <br>I kinda like the girl that I become
  <br>When I'm all alone
  <br>Since you been gone
  <p>
  <br>But now I'm calling you at 3 AM
  <br>To speak to you again
  <br>I may be acting crazy now, it's way too late
  <br>You took my heart away
  <br>But I'll be okay, 'cause
  <br>In my dreamâ€¦
