  <p> get up, I get down and I'm jumpin' around
  <br>And the rumpus and ruckus are comfortable now
  <br>Been a hell of a ride but I'm thinkin' it's time
  <br>To grow (bang! bang! bang!)</p>

  <p> <style="margin-top:30px;">So I got an apartment across from the park
  <br>Put quinoa in my fridge, still I'm not feelin' grown
  <br>Been a hell of a ride but I'm thinkin' it's time
  <br>To go (bang! bang! bang!) (here we go)</p>


  <br>So put your best face on, everybody
  <br>Pretend you know this song, everybody
  <br>Come hang
  <br>Let's go out with a bang (bang! bang! bang!)
  <br><br> I'm way too young to lie here forever
  <br>I'm way too old to try so whatever
  <br>Come hang
  <br>Let's go out with a bang (bang! bang! bang!)

  <br><br>Feel like I'm gonna puke 'cause my taxes are due
  <br>Do my password begin with a one or a two?
  <br>Been a hell of a ride but I'm thinkin' it's time
  <br>To grow (bang! bang! bang!) (metronome)
  
  <br><br>Man, I'm up to something, ooh-dee-la-dee-doe
  <br>Thank you all for comin', I hope you like the show
  <br>'Cause it's on a budget, so ooh-dee-la-dee-doe
